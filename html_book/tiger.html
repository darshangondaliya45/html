    <p><b>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a member of the genus Panthera and the largest living cat species native to
            Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black,
            mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise
            only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</b></p>
    <p><b>Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed
            forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on
            the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates such
            as deer and wild boar, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges,
            which it defends from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple
            females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for
            about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their
            own.</b></p>
